# LM-386-based-amplifier
Its an audio amplifier for low power speaker
This project showcases a compact and efficient audio amplifier built around the LM386 IC, configured to deliver a high gain of 200x (46 dB). Ideal for boosting weak audio signals from sources like microphones, smartphones, or musical instruments, this circuit drives 4-8Î© speakers with clear, amplified sound while maintaining low distortion. The design operates on a 12V DC power supply, making it suitable for both battery-powered and adapter-based applications.
